# SMART COGNITIVE GLASS

## Project Description

SMART COGNITIVE GLASS is an innovative wearable technology project designed to enhance the user's interaction with their environment through augmented reality (AR) and advanced sensor integration. 
This smart eyewear system aims to provide real-time information processing, environmental analysis, and personalized assistance to the wearer without relying on artificial intelligence.

## Key Features

1. **Augmented Reality Display**: Overlays digital information onto the user's field of view, providing contextual data about the environment.

2. **Environmental Sensors**: Monitors air quality, temperature, humidity, and other environmental factors to alert the user of potential hazards.

3. **Biometric Sensors**: Tracks the user's vital signs to provide basic health insights.

4. **GPS and Navigation**: Offers real-time location data and turn-by-turn navigation.

5. **Bluetooth Connectivity**: Integrates with smartphones for notifications and calls.

6. **Touch Controls**: Allows intuitive interaction with the device through a touch-sensitive frame.

7. **Task Management**: Provides basic reminders and to-do list functionality.

8. **Camera**: Captures photos and videos from the user's perspective.

## Technical Specifications

- **Hardware**: Custom-designed AR glasses with embedded processors, camera, and various sensors.
- **Software**: Proprietary AR algorithms and user interface, running on a custom operating system.
- **Connectivity**: Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities.
- **Battery Life**: Up to 6 hours of continuous use.
- **Weight**: Less than 75 grams for comfort during extended wear.
